## 6 Main Components of the Dow Theory

### 1. The Market Discounts Everything<br>
The Dow Theory operates on the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which states that the value of an asset at some given moment,
already takes into account all information that is known or unknown. In essence, beating the market is impossible.<br>

EMH asserts that fundamental analysis is unnecessary. If all information is already factored into the price, and fundamental analysis
consists of looking for unrealized value, then there is no point to look for unrealized value since all information has already been factored
into the current market price.<br>

It also asserts that technical analysis is unnecessary. If all information is already factored into the price, and technical analysis
consists of looking at past trends, then there is no point to look at past trends

Since all of the information is factored into the current price of the stock, we only care about the new information that comes
in. Since the price of the stock is dependent on the new information, we can assume that the price of the stock is independent
from the old information (random walk)

Once new information exists, it will be factored into the price of the stock
Since the market is efficient in updating "accurate" pricing, there is no way to beat the market because there are no
inefficiences to exploit or make a profit from

no way to indentify a bargain stock -> no fundamental analysis
no need to use past stock data since it is already factored in -> no technical analysis

The premise is that the current value of a stock is the fair and accurate value for that stock

Technical Analysis is unnecessary: If we consider the current price of a stock to be the result of all known and unknown factors,
there is no need to look at previous performance since it is already factored into the price.
Fundamental Analysis is unnecessary: Once new information becomes available, it is quickly reflected in the price of the stock

### 2. There Are Three Primary Kinds of Market Trends<br>
### 3. Primary Trends Have Three Phases<br>
### 4. Indices Must Confirm Each Other<br>
### 5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend<br>
### 6. Trends Persist Until a Clear Reversal Occurs<br>
