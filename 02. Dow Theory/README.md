<h1>Dow Theory</h1>

<h2>6 Main Components of the Dow Theory</h2>

<div align = "center"><h3>1. The Market Discounts Everything</h3></div>
The Dow Theory operates on the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which states that the value of an asset at some given moment,
already takes into account all information that is known or unknown. In simpler terms, beating the market is impossible because it is
efficient in reflecting the fair values of an asset.<br><br>

EMH asserts that fundamental analysis is unnecessary. If all information is already factored into the price, and fundamental analysis
consists of looking for unrealized value, then there is no point to look for unrealized value since all information has already been factored
into the current market price.<br>

It also asserts that technical analysis is unnecessary. If all information is already factored into the price, and technical analysis consists of
looking at past trends, then there is no point to look at past trends for a bargain price since all information has already been factored
into the current market price.<br>

<b>Weak Form:</b><br>
The weak form of EMH asserts that past market values do not have influence on future market prices (random walk). In the weak form of
EMH, technical analysis can't be used since technical analysis relies on past trends.<br><br>

<b>Semi-Strong Form:</b><br>
The semi-strong form of EMH asserts that all information, public but not private, has been factored into a current share price. This
implies that fundamental analysis can't be used because all public information has already been factored in, so there are no inefficiencies
(public) to profit off of. Technical analysis can't be used either for the above reason.<br><br>

<b>Strong Form:</b><br>
The strong form of EMH asserts that all information, public and private, has been factored into a current share price. In this case, any
analysis is unnecessary because the market is just and fair with its prices at all times, and you cannot beat the market.

<div align = "center"><h3>2. There Are Three Primary Kinds of Market Trends</h3></div>

There are three different kinds of market trends. There is a primary trend that will typically last a year or longer. This primary trend can be
a bear or bull market. Then, there are also secondary trends such as pullbacks in a bull market or rallys in the bear market. These trends
can be seen as "corrections" to an overvalued or undervalued market and can last anywhere from three weeks to three months. Lastly,
there are minor trends that are just noise.<br>

<div align = "center"><h3>3. Primary Trends Have Three Phases</h3></div>

In a bull market, there is the <b>accumulation phase</b>, the <b>public participation phase</b>, and the <b>excess phase</b>. The accumulation phase
consists of institutional investors buying up a significant amount of a stock. It is usually long and drawn out to discretely keep the price
of the stock low. In the public participation phase, the accumulation from the institutional investors may start to bring up the price of the
stock, which signals to the populous that a new trend may arise. As more people invest, it starts to drive up the price of the stock. The
excess phase is the point when the trend accelerates further creating a bubble-like situation. This is where markets can become volatile
and might signal an exit for many.

In a bear market, there is the <b>distribution phase</b>, the <b>public participation phase</b>, and the <b>panic phase</b>. In the distribution phase, the bear
market is said to begin. Investors will back out of their long positions, and may open short positions if a stock is overbought (typically by 
inexperienced investors). In the next phase, the public will start to react to the potentially overbought market and will start selling their
stock. Volume will start to decrease as buying subsides. The last phase is the panic phase where individuals with positions may begin to
worry about their losses and a mass selloff occurs. This could open up a long opportunity for smart money depending on the conditions
of the market.

<div align = "center"><h3>4. Indices Must Confirm Each Other</h3></div>

In Dow's time, he used the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Jones Transporation Average to determine new trends. He figured that
these two indicies are closely related and that if one average was trending one way, and another average was trending the other, that
there would be a new trend emerging. A major driver in the transportation sector is the ability to move products created by the industrial
sector. This means that if transportation is doing well, it might be that industries are doing well also. If industries are not doing well (yet),
then it could signal a good opportunity to buy into them. If transportation is on a downfall, it might be that industries are about to fall as
well.

<div align = "center"><h3>5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend</h3></div>

Higher volumes are a good indicator of how the trend is moving. If volume is going up in a bull market, then volumes should drop in a
pullback or reversal. The same can be said for bear markets. If the volumes are going up, then volumes should drop in a rally or a
reversal. Low volume signals a weakness in a trend.

<div align = "center"><h3>6. Trends Persist Until a Clear Reversal Occurs</h3></div>

It might be hard to tell the difference between a potential rally and a bear market. If there is no clear reversal, it might better to assume
that the trend will continue the way it is. Be careful, and when the reversal makes itself clear, then reconsider your actions.

<h2>Other Notes</h2>

<b>Closing Prices and Line Ranges:</b><br>
Dow relied solely on closing prices to signal trends rather than intraday price movement. The closing can be used to gauge the overall
sentiment of a stock. If the stock closes at a high, it may signal that many traders are willing to hold overnight. On the otherhand, if a
stock experiences a selloff, it may indicate a bearish symbol. Intraday price fluctuations are sometimes just interpretted as noise.

Another aspect important to the Dow theory is the concept of line ranges. They are lines that indicate levels of resistance and support. If
a stock's price is to stabilize within a specific line range, a trend may not be clear, and we would have to wait for a break in the support or
resistance. A break in the support could lead to a breakdown and a break in the resistance could lead to a breakout.

<b>Signals and Identification of Trends:</b><br>

<b>Reversals:</b><br>

<h2>Vocab</h2>

<b>Efficient Market Hypothesis</b>
```
A hypothesis that states that the current share price of a stock reflects all information known and unknown.
```

<b>Line Range</b>
```
A period of consolidation where the price of the stock remains under a resistance line and above a support line. Since Dow
theory suggests that we wait for a clear reversal, a person may have to wait until a line of resistance or support is broken
before making a decision.
```

<b>Peak</b>
```
The highest price of a market's movement.
```

<b>Primary Trend</b>
```
A main course of movement such as a bear or bull market.
```

<b>Pullback</b>
```
A secondary trend of a bull market where the price of a stock may temporarily drop as a way to correct an overvalued stock.
```

<b>Rally</b>
```
A secondary trend of a bull market where the price of a stock may temporarily rise as a way to correct an undervalued stock.
```

<b>Reversal</b>
```
A changing in the direction of a stock. A reversal can be a bear market becoming a bull market or vice versa.
```

<b>Secondary Trend</b>
```
An underlying course of movement such as a rally or pullback.
```

<b>Trough</b>
```
The lowest price of a market's movement.
```
