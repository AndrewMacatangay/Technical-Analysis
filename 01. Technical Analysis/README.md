# Technical Analysis of Stocks and Trends

Technical analysis is the study of historical market data in attempts to predict future price movements. This can be used to provide
traders with the information needed to make a profit. There are two major types of technical analysis which are chart patterns and
technical indicators. Chart patterns are subjective forms of technical analysis which are used to identify support and resistance levels
to predict breakdowns or breakouts. Technical indicators are statistical forms of technical analysis where mathematical formulas can be
applied to prices and volumes to help spot trends. <br> <br>
<b>Beliefs:</b><br>
1. The current market price of a stock is the product of all possible factors (known or unknown)<br>
2. Prices move in trends<br>
3. History repreats itself

## Pitfalls

Technical analysis isn't without it's downfalls. Since analyzing chart patterns may be subjective, one individual could interpret some
pattern differently than another person. One might also have to subject themselves to the belief that "history repeats itself" which can be
argued to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fundamental analysts see the market in a different light. They believe that it may be more worth-
while to dig through a company's balance sheet in search of intrinsic value that is not currently reflected in the price. On the contrary,
technical analysts believe that the price of a security is the product of all things known and unknown. In simpler terms, a faulty premise
may lead to a faulty conclusion.
