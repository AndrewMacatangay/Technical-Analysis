# Technical-Analysis
With an interest in finance and a background in programming, I'm deciding to make this repository to learn more about a world I do not
know much about. The idea of being lost and finding my way out of a maze of information is something that I find fascinating. I hope
that one day I can use this information to create something more extravagant and to show myself and others that we are more capable
of doing things we thought possible.

```
“The inside of my mind has a zillion things about it but... people that don't see inside of my mind don't
know there are a zillion things and... Y'know, since no one sees inside my mind, no one really knows.
But... one day people will know. One day people will know 'cause that's my master plan. To film it all. To
document every aspect of the life that is me. And put it in a time capsule in my backyard and so that one
day some alien or some highly evolved species will find it and... understand.”
