# Support (Support Level)

A support, or support level, is a price target where an asset will not fall below for a period of time. Typically, this area is a boundary where
traders are willing to buy a stock for a low price. Supports can also be created by investors having similar limit orders. To draw a support
level, we can draw a line along the low points of an asset's price. This line can be strictly horizontal, or it can be angled.<br><br>
Support levels can be used as indicators to know when to enter a position. If an investor is feeling bullish about a stock and the price of
the stock is at a support level, the investor may enter a long position in hopes that the price rises (reversal). On the other hand, if an
investor is feeling bearish about a stock and the price of the stock is at a support level, the investor may enter a short position in hopes
that the price falls. If the latter were to happen, the support level that has been breached can become a future resistance level.

## Pitfalls

Support is more of a market concept than it is a technical indicator. Indicators such as price by volume (PBV) charts and moving averages
are more reliable since support is limited in what it can tell us. Just because a support level is reached, it really doesn't tell us what might
happen next. A reversal may occur if the line of support has held up strong over the years, but if the support is weak, then it can either be
a long or short situation. Supports are not always horizontal or angled either. In the above graph, we can see that the support line is
drawn on a horizontal, but after the resistance has been breached, the old resistance becomes a support. We have a horizontal support
becoming an angled support. If you were to set a limit order on the horizontal support, and an uptrend occurs, then your position may
not execute if the uptrend continues. This can lead to a potential lost opportunity.

## Vocab

<b>Limit Order</b>
```
A type of order where a trader can set a price that they are willing to pay for a stock. When a seller is matched with a
buyer, the buyer will pay the amount asked, or less, if the seller was selling for less than the buyer was willing to buy
for. 
```

<b>Support</b>
```
The "floor", or price where a stock seizes to fall due to a higher demand than supply or other behavioral factors.
```
