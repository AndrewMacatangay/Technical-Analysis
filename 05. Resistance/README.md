# Resistance (Resistance Level)

A resistance, or resistance level, is a price target where an asset will not rise above of a period of time. Typically, this area is a boundary
where traders are willing to buy a stock for a low price. Resistance can also be created by investors having similar limit orders. To draw a
resistance level, we can draw a long along the high points of an asset's price. This line can be strictly horizontal, or it can be angled.

Resistance levels can be used as indicators to know when to enter a position. If an investor is feeling bearish about a stock and the price
of the stock is at a resistance level, the investor may enter a short position in hopes that the price falls (reversal). On the other hand, if an
investor is feeling bullish about a a stock and the price of the stock is at a resistance level, the investor may enter a long position in
hopes that the price rises. If the latter were to happen, the resistance level that has been breached can become a future support level.

## Pitfalls

Support is more of a market concept than it is a technical indicator. Indicators such as price by volume (PBV) charts and moving averages
are more reliable since resistance is limited in what it can tell us. Just because a resistance level has been reached, it really doesn't tell us
what might happen next. A reversal could occur if the line of resistance has held up strong over the years, but if the resistance is weak,
then it can either be a long or short situation. Resistance is not always horizontal or angled either. In the graph above, we can see that
the resistance line is drawn on a horizontal, but after the previous resistance becomes a support, the resistance can become a diagonal
instead of following the horizontal pattern it had before. If you were to set a limit order on the horizontal resistance, and an uptrend
occurs, then your position may not execute if the uptrend continues. The can lead to a potential lost opportunity.
