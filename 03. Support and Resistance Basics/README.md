# Support and Resistance Basics

Support and resistance levels are key points that technical analysts use to determine possible entering and exiting positions. Support acts
as a "floor" price of a stock and resistance acts as a "ceiling". There may be multiple floors and ceilings within a window. Since humans
are flawed and we sometimes act on our emotions, prices are sometimes decided by what we feel an asset is worth rather than what the
market would suggest is fair. This is why support and resistance levels are relevant in technical analysis.

If an asset's price is near a support level, it may signal a buying opportunity since we might think that the price of the stock is at some
local minimum. We feel as if the probability of the price to rise, is high. If an asset's price is near a resistance level, it may be a selling
opportunity since we might think that the price of the stock is at some local maximum. We feel as if the probability of the price to fall, is
high.

Trendlines are similar to support and resistance lines. We think of supports and resistance as "floors" and "ceilings", but sometimes the
floor or ceiling is not static. Sometimes the floor or ceiling is dynamic. We can think of an uptrend as an ascending staircase. The "floor"
is not flat, but instead, ascending. In an uptrend, the stock's price would be reaching sequential new peaks and troughs. In a downtrend,
we can picture this as a descending staircase. In a downtrend, the stock's price would be reaching lower sequential peaks and troughs.

## Factors That Affect Support and Resistance

<b>Moving Averages:</b><br>
Moving averages provides a way to visualize an asset's price in a different perspective. It reduces the noise in a graph by taking the
average price of some time-frame to reduce sharp up-and-down movements. Moving averages play a role in affecting support and
resistance levels since they act as some "barrier" or "threshold" to a stock. Commonly, moving averages are used as support levels in an
uptrend and resistance levels in a downtrend.<br><br>

<b>Number of Touches:</b><br>
The more times an asset's price touches a support and resistance level, and bounces off, the stronger of a barrier it becomes. Buyers and
sellers will both notice this "barrier" and human psychology will play a part in maintaining those barriers.<br><br>

<b>Preceding Price Move:</b><br>
If a stock is moving quickly in an uptrend or downtrend, it may be more likely that a resistance or support level will be met. If it is slowly
moving, then it may have an easier time sneaking past a support or resistance level. Typically, a price surge would be a result of increased
volume, and with increased volume, there are more investors to normalize the price of a stock.<br><br>

<b>Round Numbers:</b><br>
Humans like things that are simple and easy to make sense of. As a result, some support and resistance levels will be set on dollar
increments, or anything of the sort.<br><br>

<b>Time:</b><br>
Support and resistance levels may be stronger as time continually tests their validity. If a stock repeatedly hits a support level and
bounces off, it may signal a strong buying opportunity the next time it hits the support, and vice versa.<br><br>

<b>Volume:</b><br>
The more transactions that happen within a price level, the stronger those levels tend to be. Investors remember these levels and may
use them as future reference.<br><br>

## Pitfalls

Since humans sometimes act on emotions and can be irrational at times, trendlines are not always an accurate representation of what an
asset is worth. If humans were completely rational, support and resistance levels would serve no purpose since individuals would only be
interested in a company's information (fundamental analysis). Also, if we take more of a fundamentalist perspective, past trends do not
always foretell future events. Correlation does not equal causation.

## Vocab

<b>Moving Average</b>
```
A constantly changing line that smooths out past price data (filtering "noise") while also allowing the trader to identify
support and resistance levels. Commonly used intervals for moving averages are 15, 30, 100, and 200 days.
```

<b>Price Consolidation</b>
```
The price of an asset oscillating between a well-defined trading level.
```

<b>Resistance</b>
```
The "ceiling", or price where a stock seizes to rise due to a higher supply than demand or other behavioral factors.
```

<b>Round Number</b>
```
A number that acts as a common target price for investors. As humans, we tend to like things that are simple and easy to
make sense of. When buying or selling stock, human psychology may play a part into how assests are priced.
```

<b>Support</b>
```
The "floor", or price where a stock seizes to fall due to a higher demand than supply or other behavioral factors.
```

<b>Trendline</b>
```
A dynamic barrier than can be used to trace a potential support line or resistance line. In an uptrend, we would look for a
series of ascending troughs, and draw a line connecting them. This can serves as a resistance line. In a downtrend, we would
look for a series of declining peaks, and draw a line connecting them.
