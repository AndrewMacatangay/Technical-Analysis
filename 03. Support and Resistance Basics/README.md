## Pitfalls

## Vocab

<b>Moving Average</b>
```
A constantly changing line that smooths out past price data (filtering "noise") while also allowing the trader to identify
support and resistance levels. Commonly used intervals for moving averages are 15, 30, 100, and 200 days.
```

<b>Price Consolidation</b>
```
The price of an asset oscillating between a well-defined trading level.
```

<b>Resistance</b>
```
The "ceiling", or price where a stock seizes to rise due to a higher supply than demand or other behavioral factors.
```

<b>Round Number</b>
```
A number that acts as a common target price for investors. As humans, we tend to like things that are simple and easy to
makesense of. When buying or selling stock, human psychology may play a part into how assests are priced.
```

<b>Support</b>
```
The "floor", or price where a stock seizes to fall due to a higher demand than supply or other behavioral factors.
```

<b>Trendline</b>
```
A dynamic barrier than can be used to trace a potential support line or resistance line. In an uptrend, we would look for a
series of ascending troughs, and draw a line connecting them. This can serves as a resistance line. In a downtrend, we would
look for a series of declining peaks, and draw a line connecting them.
